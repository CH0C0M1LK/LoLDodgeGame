# LoLDodgeGame

 Our final 30 idea is a training mode for the popular game ***league of legends***. Dodging is a fundamentally important aspect of the game so using projectiles that spawn at random intervals we will have the player attempt to dodge around them for an extended period of time while gaining points. Once the player is hit by a projectile, they lose. There will be 3 modes; easy, medium, and hard. This will allow the player to practice the dodging aspect of the game without needing to play the game.

## Projectiles
> Not every projectile is the same and they all act differently from each other. Some are better than others such as a bigger or faster projectile. During the game, the projectiles will be randomly chosen and the player will have to react accordingly depending on the projectile coming at them. Depending on the difficulty, more projectiles will be added as well as more difficult projectiles. 

## Champions
> In league of legends, there are playable characters called ***champions***. These champions have their own unique abilities that can help them defeat other enemies but can also help them in dodging abilities. Some of these abilities can be dashes, movement speed buffs, and others such as untargetability (cannot be hit). Abilities all have unique cooldowns. This means once an ability is used, there is a set amount of time you will have to wait before you can use it again. The player will have to think carefully when they should use an ability as it could possibly cost them their score.

# Milestones

---
These are goals that are hopefully reached during our time working on it. Although we have an idea of what we want, coding in python is completely new to us so it will take some time to learn. 

## Week 1
> - Create the playing field
> - Create the champion
> - Create movement
> - Create projectiles

## Week 2
> - Timer
> - Projectile Movement/Indicators
> - Difficulties
> - Abilities
